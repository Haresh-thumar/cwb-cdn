# cwb-cdn
A lightweight, modular, and easy-to-use custom CDN containing four core CSS modules: _grid, _helper, _highlight, and _utility. This project allows developers to quickly include responsive layouts, helper classes, syntax highlighting styles, and utility-based design rules directly from a CDN—without relying on third-party frameworks.
